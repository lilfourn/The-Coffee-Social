User Experience (UX) Vibe
Website/App Design: Clean, airy layouts with rounded corners and soft shadows.

Map Feature: Custom pins shaped like coffee cups; users can “collect” visited shops.

Profile Pages: Let users showcase a “coffee passport” (stamps for visited cafes).

Gamification: Badges for milestones (e.g., “Caffeine Connoisseur” for 50 reviews).
